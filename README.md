# Sprinkles Bakery Mobile Application

Welcome to the Sprinkles Bakery Mobile Application repository. This project aims to enhance consumer interaction, optimize processes, and improve operational efficiency through the introduction of a mobile application

## Overview

Sprinkles Bakery makes a deliberate choice to improve consumer interaction and optimize processes by introducing a mobile application. By utilizing technology, they hope to provide a large selection of cupcakes suitable for different seasons and events, guaranteeing a varied and enticing product line. Their commitment to giving their consumers value is further demonstrated by the provision of special offers during different seasons.
